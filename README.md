<h1>🐾 Feed the Cat - Game Jam Project</h1>
Feed the Cat is a short, quirky game created for the Game Parade Jam. Your mission? Keep your daughter's beloved cat well-fed and happy — but be careful! Give him the wrong food or ignore his needs, and he might just tear the whole flat apart!

🕹️ Gameplay
Feed the cat the correct food at the right time.

Watch out for signs of mischief — an angry cat means chaos!

Balance your time and attention to avoid property damage and keep your daughter's pet safe and satisfied.
